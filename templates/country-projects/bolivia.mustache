  <p><strong>When: </strong>2004-2019</p>

  <p><strong>Which tools: </strong>Economy-wide models (Maquette for MDG Simulation or MAMS); Analysis of Exogenous Shocks and Economic and Social Protection Model (MACEPES); Computable General Equilibrium (CGE)-UNDESA with energy models, and in-built human development, poverty and inequality microsimulation models; and energy modelling (OSeMOSYS and the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning or LEAP model). A Climate, Land, Environment and Water Systems (CLEWS) model is under development.</p>

  <p><strong>Who’s involved: </strong> Government of Bolivia (Unit of Social and Economic Policy Analysis, Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Hydrocarbons, Ministry of Planning of Development, Ministry of Environment and Water) supported by UNDESA, UNDP, KTH-DESA, SEI-US and IAEA</p>

  <p><strong>What’s happening: </strong> Since 2006, collaborative activities have included joint meetings with high-level government officials to discuss modelling results; joint dissemination seminars; training of technical government officials from diverse ministries and joint funding of activities. Quantitative analyses supported by capacity development have had an important role in informing policy decisions. Energy models, for instance, were used to prepare the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions document presented by Bolivia in negotiations leading up to the Paris Agreement on climate change. The economy-wide model has aided in framing and updating national development plans, including to assess the economic and social impacts of investment plans derived from the energy planning model. A CLEWS model under development is aimed at analysing issues connected to agriculture, mining, water use and energy access. </p>
