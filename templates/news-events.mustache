    <h2>CLEWs modelling training starts in Ghana</h2>

    <strong>16 May 2018</strong>

    <img src="/images/news-events/956b0aacb34f231e178b81505fd17285.jpg">

    <p>From 7 to 11 May, Ghana’s first training workshop on the CLEWs integrated analysis framework took place in Accra. The workshop was organized by UNDESA, UNDP and the University of Ghana, with participation from the Energy Commission, the Northern Development Authority, the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority and the University of Ghana. Three workshops on the CLEWs modelling framework are planned for the project.</p>

    <p>Participants engaged in hands-on exercises on the energy dimension of CLEWs. Scenario exercises explored key policy areas, namely; i) the vulnerability of hydropower generation to droughts, specifically in relation to climate change; ii) promotion of renewable energy; iii) prospects and viability of waste to energy projects; and iv) energy efficiency. On the final day, the preliminary results from the scenario modelling were presented. Meetings with the UNDP country office and country counterparts were held to plan project implementation.</p>

    <img src="/images/news-events/7def39570d2999f2d8a77ff27579e3a7.jpg">

    <p>At the request of the Social and Economic Policy Analysis Unit, a three-day workshop on hydrological modelling using the Water Evaluation and Planning System (WEAP) was held in La Paz from 11 to 13 April. The workshop was organized by UNDESA, UNDP and the Social and Economic Policy Analysis Unit, and co-facilitated by a UNDP consultant along with two specialists from the Ministry of Environment and Water. Ten officials from the Social and Economic Policy Analysis Unit and the National Load Dispatch Committee, who are part of the interinstitutional team of government officials being trained in integrated tools, attended the workshop.</p>

    <p>Integrated water resource management concepts were introduced, complemented with hands-on exercises and model exploration. Participants became familiar with WEAP's interface and functionalities, and with Bolivia's Surface Water Balance model (BHSB) in WEAP, its components, methodology and main results. The BHSB was developed by the Ministry of Environment and Water in collaboration with the Stockholm Environment Institute. It is the main input for water balance data used in the CLEWs model for Bolivia.</p>

    <h2>Scoping mission to Dakar completed</h2>

    <img src="/images/news-events/73448563b4c6bf65399d0258088fc4f7.jpg">

    <p>A scoping mission to Dakar, Senegal assessed prospects for UNDESA and UNDP to help develop capacities in integrated methodologies that support evidence-based sustainable development policies. The mission included meetings with the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Finance, Economy and Planning at various levels, the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Agency of Civil Aviation and Meteorology, and the UNDP country office. </p>

    <p>The mission found strong interest from all ministries and specialized departments. There is pre-existing capacity in energy, systems dynamic, water management and climate modelling, which is a valuable input for delivering a country project. No significant capacity on multisectoral integrated modelling was found, however, which is where the proposed project could be of greatest value. The government of Senegal will discuss how to coordinate the project and potential contributions to implementation.</p>

    <h2>Mission to start capacity development in CLEWs modelling in Ghana</h2>

    <strong>24 July 2017</strong>

    <p>During the week of 17 to 21 July, UNDESA and IAEA, conducted a workshop and data gathering mission to Accra to start the implementation of a CLEWs capacity development project in Ghana. The mission and workshop are part of the joint initiative of UNDESA and UNDP to promote in-depth capacity development on modelling tools to inform sustainable development policies. The policy relevance and main methodological features of the CLEWs integrated assessment modelling tool were presented along with the preliminary results developed by three government officials trained in the CLEWs Trieste Summer School organized in 12-30 June 2017. The presentation of preliminary results by the government team significantly increased the interest of the government institutions participating in the workshop as it clearly demonstrated the relevance and utility of the tool. The mission was successful in defining the data requirements, strategy of engagement of modelling teams in national institutions, and refining the policy objectives of the project.</p>

    <h2>Modelling Sustainable Development in Bolivia</h2>

    <p>Since 2006, UNDESA and UNDP, have been supporting the Plurinational State of Bolivia to strengthen the analytical capacities of government officials to inform development policies by using modelling tools. Through several capacity development projects, economy-wide and energy systems models have been transferred and a set of policy scenarios have been developed to address key issues of interest to the government.  This collaboration has resulted in several contributions, including publications and policy notes prepared by government officials to disseminate the results and the findings of the modelling assessments.  An inter-ministerial modelling team of government officials has been established that is now capable to undertake policy analysis in response to requests from senior decision-makers.</p>

    <img src="/images/news-events/c66911d0a9eb905299582ea876c86e61.jpg">

    <h3>Bolivia: Impact of capacity development shaping policies in Bolivia</h3>

    <p>The utility of such projects has been highlighted on several occasions. For example, one of the general equilibrium models transferred by UNDESA was useful for informing the 2025 Patriotic Agenda by estimating GDP growth and government budget requirements to finance the implementation of plans and programs. The OSeMOSYS energy model enabled the Unit for Social and Economic Policy Analysis (UDAPE) of the Ministry of Development Planning to contribute analysis to support an assessment of energy sector development to help establish Bolivia's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) under the Paris agreement. Furthermore, the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning system of the country (LEAP) was updated by UNDESA, in collaboration with the Royal Institute of Technology of Sweden (KTH), and UNDP support. As a result of this, a conference was organized to disseminate the results of both energy models to a wide audience, addressing both contributions and limitations to key features of Bolivia’s Plan for Economic and Social Development 2016-2020 (PDES).  Selected policy notes using the energy models were used to inform the Energy Development Plan of the Ministry of Hydrocarbons.</p>

    <img src="/images/news-events/6356773ae86d853e714a2d97444c7f6b.jpg">

    <p>Likewise, in the Symposium "Promotion of inclusive and responsible public administration for sustainable development" that took place on March 16 and 17, 2016, Mrs. Mirna Mariscal, Subdirector of Macroeconomic Policy of UDAPE, highlighted the importance of capacity development projects to strengthen the technical expertise of the Government in the use and improvement of economic and energy models.</p>

    <p>The tools that are part of the UNDESA-UNDP portfolio include economy-wide models with modules in energy, health and human development; micro-simulations to assess the impact of policies on poverty dynamics and other household socio-economic indicators; energy systems models and energy planning. Currently, an integrated methodology of climate, land use, energy and water (CLEWs) is under development, which facilitates the analyses of interrelationships between the three dimensions of sustainable development -economic, environmental and social- in policy design and planning.</p>

    <p>Bolivia’s continuous engagement with the modelling tools and the evidence of their use to inform policies is a good example of the importance of making innovative and tailored models accessible to developing countries.</p>
