  <h1>Background</h1>

  <p>The 2030 Agenda’s integrated vision of development means that progress on any given issue depends on progress on many others.</p>

  <p>Realizing the Agenda as well as the Paris Agreement on climate change requires careful management of complex links and trade-offs. Public policies need to balance diverse sectors, levels of government, and stakeholder interests over the short, medium and long term. Success depends in part on good planning and informed decision-making, which can be guided by modeling tools that provide insights and analysis.</p>

  <p>The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have pioneered a series of modelling tools. Early initiatives included economy-wide modeling and microsimulation methodologies. More recently, energy systems modelling, geospatial energy-access modelling, and the integrated modelling of climate, land-use, water and energy have been developed.</p>

  <h1>Responding to National Needs</h1>

  <p>The tools are tailored to the unique circumstances and policy requirements of each country. Developing capacities to use them follows a “learning by doing” philosophy that brings together national teams and international experts.</p>

  <p>Together, policymakers, UN staff, data and modelling experts:
    <ol>
      <li>Build and tailor models to national development contexts</li>
      <li>Strengthen government capacities to apply modelling tools to inform decision-making</li>
      <li>Comunicate findings to the highest levels of government to guide policies</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
